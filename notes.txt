instructor actions:
  - create a cohort
  - create a project, specifying the cohort, project has all the same students that cohort has
  - view students in a cohort, along w/ their sites
  - generate a tour
  - generate signup link for this cohort


student actions:
  - create account; either choosing the cohort they're in, or via a signup link w/ the cohort param in it
  - view available projects within the cohort, go to one of them
  - creates their site within the project
  - view their visit schedule


features:
  - create projects: these allow for submissions, then the instructor spawns a tour off of it once all submissions are in
  - make visit_and_host_every_round first
  - tourRound is not necessary, just have tourVisit belong_to tour, just for scoping purposes
  - consider tracking the duration of each visit
  - let students visit sites w/o a timer. do not create the visit permutations up front. when the student clicks Next Visit, just send them to a site they haven't been to yet this tour
  - iframe the heroku site into the student visit site
  - what about non-heroku things, like hardware projects? maybe the iframe could render a youtube embed if the url is youtube
  - content moderation function for instructors
